# Arkansas River Water Flow Prediction

### Description
This project uses an LSTM model to forecast the future water flow of the Arkansas river at the Parkdale USGS monitoring site. It utilizes the USGS data along with snowpack data for the upper Arkansas basin from the Nation Weather and Climate Center and the water discharge data from the upstream Twin Lakes and Turquoise reservoirs. The purpose of this project is to forecast what the future white water rafting conditions could be for the Parkdale area, but it can be repurposed to other rivers provided that the USGS, snowpack, and reservoir data sources are changed accordingly.

### Instructions
Run notebook file in Google Collab. Set the "end_date" variable to the current day to forecast the future.
